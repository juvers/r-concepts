# Overview

The Rockefeller Center site is a [Hybrid Single Page Application], with each
page standing alone at its own static url, but with navigation between pages
performed partially or entirely on the client side.

As such, the site is composed as a tree of related layout node types,
starting at the root with the [App], and branching to multiple [Pages]
(one for each URL), with each page being composed of one of the [Layouts],
and one or more [Blocks].

When looking at an individual page on the site, the basic outline
of its composition is:

<Box m={4} sx={{width: '340px', border: '1px solid gray'}}>
  <Grid p={2} gap={1} bg="white" color="black" sx={{placeItems: 'center'}}>
    <RockefellerCenterLogoSvg height="30px" />
    <Text>App > MenuBar</Text>
  </Grid>
  <Box p={2} sx={{borderTop: '1px solid gray'}}>
    <Text p={2}>App > Page > Layout</Text>
    <Text p={5} bg="primary" color="textInverted">
      App > Page > Layout > Block
    </Text>
    <Text p={5}>App > Page > Layout > Block</Text>
    <Text p={5} bg="secondary" color="textInverted">
      App > Page > Layout > Block
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box bg="black" p={5}>
    <Text color="white">App > Footer</Text>
  </Box>
</Box>

When creating pages, most of the effort will typically go into creating
and composing [Blocks] with data, and wrapping that composition with
one of the [Layouts].

## App

The App is a singleton that automatically wraps every page, which means
pages should never need to provide any of the 'global' features of the site,
such as the [MenuBar], overlay [Layers], or the [Footer].

Though pages aren't responsible for rendering these 'global' elements,
they can modify aspects of them through [Page Config].

See the [App src], [gatsby-browser] and [gatsby-ssr] for more.

## Pages

Pages are composed from one of the [Layouts] together with
one or more content [Blocks].

Common examples of pages are 'landing' or 'index' pages, like [home]
or [events]. These types of pages are typically not generated from data
(though the content they display may be). They are defined in the [pages
src directory], and they always map **1-to-1** to URLs.

Pages that have the same Layout and same Blocks,
but different URLs and data are called [Templates].

## Templates

Templates are like [Pages], except they are parameterized by some context,
such as a _slug_ or _id_, which allows them to use the same page layout
and blocks with different content, depending on the context.

Common examples of templates are 'detail' pages, like [event]. These types
of pages are typically generated from data (i.e., a page is created for every
event using the [event] template). They are defined in the [templates src
directory], and they can map **1-to-many** to URLs.

## Page Config

Pages (and templates) can export configuration that will be incorporated
into [page context] and used by the [App] when rendering the 'global'
features of the site, like the [MenuBar].

Pages can define configuration by exporting a `config` object that conforms
to the [PageConfig interface]. For example:

```tsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import {jsx} from '@tishman/components';
import {Layout} from '~layouts';

import type {PageConfig} from '~PageConfig';

export const config: PageConfig = {
  // Theme the global elements of app.
  theme: 'Rock Center Black',
  // Change the MenuBar logo.
  logo: 'Rainbow Room',
  // Show a short page name below the logo.
  pageName: 'Bar SixtyFive',
  // Define a CTA to be shown in the menubar.
  cta: {to: '/plan-an-event', label: 'Plan an Event'},
  // Define a nav element to appear to the right of the logo.
  rightNav: {to: '/dining-club', label: 'Dining Club'},
  // Define a nav element to replace them menu toggle button.
  leftNav: {to: '/', label: 'Back'},
};

export default function Page(): JSX.Element {
  return <Layout>{/* render blocks here */}</Layout>;
}
```

Though page config is optional, most pages will probably want to define
at least a minimal bit of configuration.

## Meta

Every page should define the basic meta data, including a title and description.

There are two ways to provide the metadata for your page:

### Metadata from a page query

This is the preferred method, as it allows the content of the metadata to be
maintained along side other content for the page (i.e., through the CMS or
JSON).

The basic idea of how to do this is as follows:

- your page defines a [page query]
- your query has a top-level field named (or aliased to) `meta`
- somewhere within the `meta` field query, there is a _string_ field named
  (or aliased to) `title`
- somewhere within the `meta` field query, there is a _string_ field named
  (or aliased to) `description`

With these criteria met, the app will automatically update
the title and description meta tags when the page loads.

Here's an example of a page query for fetching meta from the CMS:

```graphql
export const HomeMetaQuery = graphql`
  query HomeMeta {
    meta: sanityHomePage {
      seo {
        title: metaTitle
        description: metaDescription
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

And fetching meta from JSON:

```graphql
export const query = graphql`
  query SearchMeta {
    meta: dataJson(id: {eq: "search"}) {
      meta {
        title
        description
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

### Metadata from page config

> Note: it is generally preferable to use the previous method rather than
> page config, since it allows the meta data to be managed alongside other
> page data.

Meta data can also be provided on [page config], like so:

```ts
export const config: PageConfig = {
  /* ...other page config here */
  meta: {
    title: 'Some page!',
    description: 'A description. Not too short, not too long. juuuust right!',
  },
};
```

## Layouts

A Layout describes features that are common across one or more pages,
such as a common theme, shared [styled] components, a shared navigation,
page transitions, etc.

Every page should render a Layout.

See the [Layouts documentation] for more.

## Blocks

A Block is kind of 'glue' component that connects some data to a component
or list of components. It may include static data queries, or code that
validates and sanitizes data props that may be passed to it from a Page.

See the [Blocks documentation] for more.
