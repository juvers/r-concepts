# Menu

This is the main menu for the Rockefeller Center app. In the app,
it is hidden by default, and revealed by the [MenuToggleButton]
in the [MenuBar].

## UX and A11y Affordances

The menu itself does nothing to trap focus within the menu, as it should
be displayed in a [Modal] which will move and trap focus in the menu
and restore focus to the triggering element on close.

The menu is rendered as two [nav] elements, the first labeled "main menu"
and the second labeled "secondary menu".

### Main Menu

The main menu is rendered as a list of lists, with each nested list
corresponding to a thematically grouped of menu links. While structurally,
this creates two levels of navigation, the UX for the main menu diverges
from this structure on large screens.

#### Main Menu on Large Screens

On large screens, the main menu is displayed as a grid of groups of
navigation links, each with a heading. Focus flows naturally through the
items in group-item order.

#### Main Menu on Small Screens

On small screens, the main menu is reduced to a list of buttons,
one for each group of navigation links.

Each button reveals a slide overlay with a nested list of
the grouped navigation links. While the overlay is open,
it traps focus within the list.

The overlay list supports dismissal via a swipe gesture,
or via a close button. Upon close, focus will be returned to
the triggering menu group button.

### Secondary Menu

The secondary menu behaves as a standard list of navigation links
on small and large screens.

## Props

<Props of={Menu} />

## Usage

```ts
import {Menu} from '~menu';
```
