# SearchMenu

This is the search menu for the Rockefeller Center app. In the app,
it is hidden by default, and revealed by clicking on the search button
in the [MenuBar].

## UX and A11y Affordances

The search menu itself does nothing to trap focus with the menu,
as it should be displayed in a [Modal] which will move and trap focus
in the menu and restore focus to the triggering element on close.

The search menu is rendered as a form with an input and submit button,
followed by a [nav] of suggested 'quick' links.

## Props

<Props of={SearchMenu} />

## Usage

```ts
import {Menu} from '~menu';
```

<Playground>
  <LocationProvider route="/" history={createHistory(createMemorySource('/'))}>
    <SearchMenu
      to="#"
      suggestions={[
        {label: 'Top of the Rock', to: '#'},
        {label: 'Christmas Tree', to: '#'},
        {label: 'Top of the Rock', to: '#'},
        {label: 'Christmas Tree', to: '#'},
        {label: 'Top of the Rock', to: '#'},
        {label: 'Christmas Tree', to: '#'},
      ]}
    />
  </LocationProvider>
