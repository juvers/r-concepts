Rockefeller, Jr. during the Great Depression, employing upwards of ​75,000 people​, the complex was a daring invitation to embrace the future even amid the uncertainty of the present—“a Depression-era version of building the pyramids​,” hailed The New York Times. By the 1950s, Rockefeller Center had become a cultural totem, thanks in part to NBC broadcasts. The Today Show was filmed here, and media icons like Time, Life, and The Associated Press were headquartered here. “Every informed man in the world knows about Rockefeller Center,” wrote one journalist."
