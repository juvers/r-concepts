However the idea came about, The Rink was the perfect fit for the sunken plaza, which was struggling to attract shoppers as the entrance to the high-end retailers in the underground concourse. The Rink, or “skating pond” as it was first known, officially opened on Christmas Day 1936. Originally planned as a temporary exhibit, The Rink was so popular it became a permanent addition, with the Prometheus Statue and the Christmas Tree providing one of the most familiar backdrops in the world.",
