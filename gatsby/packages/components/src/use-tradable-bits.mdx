# useTradableBits Hook

Rockefeller Center has been using tradablebits as their third party social media aggregator.

They are able to take in all posts with a certain hashtags and make a custom list of approved
posts. These lists are sorted by labels. most labels are the hashtag with the `#` removed and
downcased. `#TopOfTheRock` => `topoftherock` but be careful, this is not a certain thing.
I ran into issue where they decided to add `-` to the label and spent an entire night debugging

Their API is pretty straight forward and can be broken down into three basic arugments
labels, maxItems, network. We can now have access to tradablebits data through this hook.

### Default Usage

Including no arguments will fetch the default config seen below.

```typescript
const data = useTradableBits();
```

### Custom arguments

Or we can overwrite the config and request, for example, 4 items with label `rainbowroom` for a grid on its landing page

```typescript
const data = useTradableBits({maxItems: 4, labels: ['rainbowroom']});
```

### Add an error boundary

Inside hook if the api fetch fails, it will throw an error. For any component that is using
this hook, you should wrap it in an `<ErrorBoundary />` that will catch that error gracefully.
Check out their github page to see how it works. [react-error-boundary github page](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary)

```typescript
import {ErrorBoundary} from 'react-error-boundary';
```

This is very important as it can handle any errors gracefully with out taking down the entire page.

## Props

<Props of={useTradableBits} />

## Default Usage

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const data = useTradableBits();
    return (
      <Box>
        {data ? (
          <Box sx={{height: 400, overflow: 'scroll'}}>
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
          </Box>
        ) : (
          <Spinner />
        )}
      </Box>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Example with custom arguments

```typescript
const maxItems = 4;
const data = useTradableBits({maxItems});
```

```typescript
const data = useTradableBits({maxItems: 4});
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const maxItems = 4;
    const data = useTradableBits({maxItems});
    return (
      <Box>
        {data ? (
          <Box sx={{height: 400, overflow: 'scroll'}}>
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
          </Box>
        ): (
