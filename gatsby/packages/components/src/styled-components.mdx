# Styled Components

These components are [styled] primitives that can be used to render
rich text data, such as [MDX] content or [portable text].

## TODO: Create/Document/figure out what this is

Thoughts:

- Should use [sectioning] components in all appropriate instances
  - in particular, `h1`, `h2`, etc components should use corresponding variants,
    but render an `H`, **not** a corresponding heading level.
- Should be themeable like theme-ui's [styled] components
- Should be used in place of theme-ui's [MDX] and docz's [components]
- Should be used to render rich text from Sanity [portable text]
- Most of them _could_ simply **be** theme-ui's components,
  with only sectioning or other more custom versions swapped in.
