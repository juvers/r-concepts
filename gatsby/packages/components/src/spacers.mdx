# Spacers

Throughout the designs we have inline lists broken up with dot `Â·`

Use the `<Spacer />` component to add that dot between the lines of text

## Playground

<Playground>
  <Text>
    <Spacer>I have a </Spacer>
    <Spacer>seperating each bit</Spacer>
    <Spacer>of this sentence,</Spacer>
    <Spacer>but not the last span!</Spacer>
  </Text>
</Playground>
