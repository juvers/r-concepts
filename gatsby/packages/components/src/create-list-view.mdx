# createListView

`createListView` creates a [Zustand] state hook
for managing a filterable list of items.

## Usage

```typescript
import {createListView} from '@tishman/components';
```

> See the guide on [List Views] for more examples.

### Creating the list view hook

If the list data is known statically, you can create the hook
statically, as well:

```tsx
const useListView = createListView({
  /**
   * Optional: the initial items to store for the list view.
   *
   * Items may also be provided via the `add` function returned by the hook,
   * for situations where the items aren't known statically.
   */
  items: [
    {color: 'White', attraction: 'Rock Center'},
    {color: 'Black', attraction: 'Rock Center'},
    {color: 'White', attraction: 'The Rink'},
    {color: 'Navy', attraction: 'The Rink'},
    {color: 'White', attraction: 'Top of the Rock'},
    {color: 'Yellow', attraction: 'Top of the Rock'},
    {color: 'Green', attraction: 'Top of the Rock'},
  ],
  /**
   * Optional: the possible field names the list may be filtered by.
   *
   * This may be a field name, an array of field names,
   * or an object that maps display names to dot-separated path strings.
   *
   * @example
   * // As a field name:
   * filterBy: 'title',
   * // As an array of field names:
   * filterBy: ['title', 'category'],
   * // As a map of display names to path strings:
   * filterBy: {type: 'category.subCategory'},
   */
  filterBy: ['color', 'attraction'],
  /**
   * Optional: the field name to group items by.
   *
   * This may be a field name or dot-separated path string.
   *
   * @example
   * // As a field name:
   * groupBy: 'title',
   * // As a path string:
   * groupBy: 'category.subCategory',
   */
  groupBy: 'color',
  /**
   * The group scale. Defaults to `'alpha'`.
   *
   * `'alpha'` means groups will be created for the range of sorted
   * first characters of the values of the `groupBy` field.
   *
   * `'numeric'` means groups will be created for the range of sorted
   * number values of the `groupBy` field.
   *
   * `'date'` means groups will be created for the range of dates
   * that covers the values of the `groupBy` field.
   */
  groupScale: 'alpha',
});
```

## Loading items

When data is not known statically, you have a couple of options:

You can create the hook statically, and then use the `add` function
to add items to the list:

```tsx
const useListData = createListView(/* ... */);

const ListView = () => {
  const add = useListData((state) => state.add);
  // Handwaving: this represents some kind of data loading effect.
  const data = useSomeAsyncDataSource();

  // Add the items from the data whenever they load.
  useEffect(() => {
    // Assuming data is a list of items...
    add(...data);
  }, [add, data]);
  // ...
};
```

## Querying items in Gatsby

Or, if all the data will be loaded via a Gatsby query,
you might opt to create the hook as state on initialization:

```tsx
const ListView = () => {
  // Data loaded via Gatsby query will be available on first render,
  // so there is no need for any async effect.
  const data = useStaticQuery(/* ... */);
  // Notice we wrapped this in a `useState`initializer
  // so we only create the`useListData` hook once.
  const [useListData] = useState(() => createListView({items: data /* ... */}));
  // ...
};
```

> The hook created by `createListView` is a [Zustand] state hook that returns
> some useful data and setter functions.
>
> The below sections assume creating a hook from `createListView` like:
>
> ```tsx
> const useListView = createListView(/* ... */);
> ```

## items

The list of items to display in the list view. If the list view has been
configured with any filters, and if any of those filters have been applied,
then this list will reflect that state.

```tsx
const items = useListView((state) => state.items);
```

You can use this list to render a flat list of items.

```tsx
// `id` and `name` would be fields on every item in the data set.
items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);
```

## groups

The list of items, grouped by the field specified in the `groupBy` [config].
If `groupBy` has not been configured, this will be a list of one anonymous
group that contains all items.

```tsx
const groups = useListView((state) => state.groups);
```

Each group in the list is an object:

### group.name

The list of names derived from the unique values of the `groupBy` field.

```ts
const groupNames = groups.map((group) => group.name);
```

### group.hasItems

A boolean indicating that `group.items` is not empty. Empty groups are possible
when there are no items in the filtered state that belong to the group.

```ts
const groupsWithItems = groups.filter((group) => group.hasItems);
```

### group.items

The list of items that belong to the group.

```ts
// Don't do this, lol. Just use `items` from the hook state.
const allItems = groups.reduce((all, group) => [...all, ...group.items], []);
```

## options

The list of options derived from the `filterBy` [config]. This is useful
(along with the [filter] setter) for creating form fields for filtering
the list of items.

```ts
const options = useListView((state) => state.options);
```

Each option is a tuple containing the filter field name
and the list of possible values:

```ts
options.map(([fieldName, values]) => (
  <label key={fieldName}>
    {fieldName}
    <select>
      {values.map((value) => (
        <option key={value}>{value}</option>
      ))}
    </select>
  </label>
));
```

## filter

A setter that applies a filter for the given field name and value.

```ts
const filter = useListView((state) => state.filter);
```

Calling filter with a field name and a value will apply that filter
such that the next state's [items] will only include items that pass
the filter (and any other filters that are currently applied):

```ts
<button onClick={() => filter('color', 'Green')}>Only Green</button>
```

## reset

A setter that resets the filter for the given field name, or **all**
filters, if no filter name is given.

```ts
const reset = useListView((state) => state.reset);

<button onClick={() => reset('color')}>All Colors</button>
<button onClick={() => reset()}>Clear all filters</button>
```

## add

A setter that adds items to the list view. This is useful in scenarios
where the list of items is not known ahead of time, or might grow over time.

```ts
const add = useListView((state) => state.add);

// Neat! A theoretical hook that loads more data whenever you call next!
const next = useSomeCoolPaginatingDataLoaderHook((data) => add(...data));

<button onClick={next}>Thank U</button>;
