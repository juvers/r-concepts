# History Card

### Properties

<Props of={HistoryCard} />

### Portrait Image Card

In designs, there are two types of History cards

Portrait cards have a narrower box wrapper so they can scale

proportionally to the landscape image cards

This is mainly to ensure the lines do not cross when narrowing the window

<Playground>
  <HistoryCard
    type="PORTRAIT"
    title="1900"
    caption="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor."
    image={{
      fluid: getMockFluidImage({width: 315, height: 440}).childImageSharp.fluid,
      alt: 'mock image',
    }}
    isEven={false}
  />
</Playground>

### Landscape Image Card

Landcape Card have a wider box wrapper so they can be proportionally sized to the
taller portrait cards

<Playground>
  <HistoryCard
    type="LANDSCAPE"
    title="1900"
    caption="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor."
    image={{
      fluid: getMockFluidImage({width: 400, height: 284}).childImageSharp.fluid,
      alt: 'mock image',
    }}
    isEven={false}
  />
</Playground>

### With Did You Know Card

If card data includes didYouKnow prop,
a did you know card will be attached to the history card

Best practice is if left card has a did you know,
the right one should also have it or hearHistory to balance out
the vertical spacing else it will have a large empty space

<Playground>
  <HistoryCard
    type="LANDSCAPE"
    title="1900"
    caption="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor."
    image={{
      fluid: getMockFluidImage({width: 400, height: 284}).childImageSharp.fluid,
      alt: 'mock image',
    }}
    isEven={false}
    didYouKnow="The Rink features in the NBC shows taped at 30 Rock—having made cameos on Saturday Night Live's Christmas shows and during NBC News’ coverage of past presidential elections."
  />
</Playground>

### With Hear History Card

If card data includes hearHistory prop,
a hear history card will be attached to the history card

Best practice is if left card has a did you know,
the right one should also have it or did you know card to balance out
the vertical spacing else it will have a large empty space

(Note we currently dont have audio so hearHistory is of string type.
That will likely need to be updated if they want to use this component)
